## Task 2

You are provided with the following HTML and CSS code that sets up the structure for a circular progress bar. The goal of this task is to complete the functionality by writing a script that checks if the value inside the `span` element (inside the `.progress-circle` div) is an integer. If the value is a valid integer, the progress bar should dynamically reflect this value as a percentage (0 to 100%).
